# Burp-Audio
Burp Suite Audio Cues extension adds sound to Burp Suite.  If you are new to burp, you likely have experienced that moment when you've set your proxy, and then stared at the browser for a couple seconds trying to figure out why the web application won't load.  Then you notice that you must forward the request.  Audio cues extension alerts you on page requests, pages with parameters, and on vulnerabilities.  It's also configurable so you can turn off some sounds when it gets annoying.
